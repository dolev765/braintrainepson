SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS - COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE
==================================================

This document contains all semantic relationship categories used in the semantic judgment task.
Each category includes descriptions, difficulty levels, tier classifications, and example pairs.

IMPORTANT NOTE: All semantic relationships have been comprehensively reviewed and corrected for accuracy.
MASSIVE SYSTEMATIC ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED:

1. ANTONYMS CATEGORY - MASSIVE ISSUE (FIXED)

   - Examples Fixed: "hot-warm"→"hot-color", "fast-quick"→"fast-shape", "big-large"→"big-color"

2. SPATIAL CATEGORY - MASSIVE ISSUE (FIXED)  
   - Problem: Almost all "unrelated" pairs were actually related spatial concepts
   - Examples Fixed: "north-center"→"north-texture", "left-center"→"left-shape"

3. TEMPORAL CATEGORY - MASSIVE ISSUE (FIXED)
   - Problem: Almost all "unrelated" pairs were actually related temporal concepts  
   - Examples Fixed: "dawn-summer"→"dawn-shape", "past-modern"→"past-shape"

ALL MAJOR ISSUES FIXED:
✅ Antonyms, Spatial, Temporal, Size, Quantity, Weather, Body categories - COMPLETELY FIXED

- ABSTRACT SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS: Tests higher-order semantic processing
- HIGH COGNITIVE LOAD RELATIONSHIPS: Tests complex cognitive processing
- NEUROCOGNITIVE RELATIONSHIPS: Tests neurocognitive process understanding
- METACOGNITIVE RELATIONSHIPS: Tests metacognitive awareness

================================================================================
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

For each semantic relationship category:
1. Read the description carefully
2. Look at the example pairs provided
3. Press 'J' if the pair is related according to the category rules
4. Press 'F' if the pair is unrelated according to the category rules
5. Respond as quickly and accurately as possible

The system tracks your performance across different semantic categories and difficulty levels to assess your semantic processing abilities.
