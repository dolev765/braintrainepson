## Progress Tracking

### Session Results
After each session, you'll see:
- **Correct Answers**: Number of correct responses out of 32
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct responses
- **Final Level**: Difficulty level reached

### Progress Chart
- **Red Line**: Final level (last session each day)
- **Green Line**: Highest level (maximum reached each day)
- **Blue Line**: Lowest level (minimum reached each day)

### Level Progression
- **Advance**: ≤3 errors in a session
- **Maintain**: 4-6 errors in a session
- **Decrease**: ≥3 consecutive failures

## Tips for Success

### General Tips
1. **Pay Attention to Rules**: Rules change between trials
2. **Respond Quickly**: You have limited time to respond
3. **Practice Regularly**: Consistent practice improves performance
4. **Start Easy**: Begin with Classic Mode if you're new

### For Physical Property Rule
- Focus on the **format** of the numbers, not their meaning
- Arabic numerals: 1, 2, 3, etc.
- Written words: "one", "two", "three", etc.
- Roman numerals: I, II, III, etc.

### For Meaning Rule
- Focus on the **value** the numbers represent
- 4, "four", and IV all represent the same number
- Ignore the format differences

### For Semantic Categories
- Think about the **relationship** between the words
- Consider context and real-world associations
- Don't overthink - go with your first instinct
